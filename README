This package contains scripts for testing network namespaces.  The
"netns" file is a library sourced by the other scripts.  Along with its
associate harness files, this does most of the topology configuration
and test report generation.  The including scripts just define topology
variables and the respective tests.  See "t????" for examples.

Each test script has this name format:
	t####
	 ||\\_ 2 digit identifier
	 |\___ routing { 0:static, 1:rip, 2:ospf, 3:isis, 4:bgp, >4:undefined}
	 \____ inet { 0:ipv4, 1:ipv6, >1:undefined}
